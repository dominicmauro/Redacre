The Honorable, the Chief Blogger and the Associate Bloggers of the Supreme Blog of the United States. Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! All persons having business before the Honorable, the Supreme Blog of the United States, are admonished to draw near and give their attention for the Blog is now sitting. God save the United States and this Honorable Blog.

This is a block quote:

> I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as under the Constitution and laws of the United States; and that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.”

Redacre supports **Bold** and *Italic* text. We don't really do underlines here except for [hyperlinked text][1].

	This paragraph is preformatted text.

This is an unordered list of Supreme Court Justices who were promoted from Associate to Chief Justice:

- John Rutledge
- Edward Douglass White
- Charles Evans Hughes
- Harlan F. Stone
- William Rehnquist

This is an ordered list of living justices of the Supreme Court (as of December 2018):

1. John Paul Stevens
2. Sandra Day O’Connor
3. Anthony Kennedy
4. David Souter

Redacre supports four levels of headings. H1 is reserved for the title of the site at the top of this page, and H2 is reserved for the title of this post. That leaves two levels of headings to be used within a post:

### Heading 3

Fun Supreme Court fact number one: The Supreme Court first assembled on February 1, 1790, in the Merchants Exchange Building in New York City – then the Nation’s Capital. 

#### Heading 4

Fun Supreme Court fact number two: Chief Justice John Jay was forced to postpone the initial meeting of the Court until the next day since, due to transportation problems, some of the Justices were not able to reach New York until February 2.
